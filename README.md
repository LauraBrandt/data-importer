# End Hunger - Durham

A quick, node.js-based, script that is used to import data from the endhunger.com website. This is a shim for loading the data for the prototype and initial builds. Ideally this will be replaced with a better service.

To run this script, you'll need a google maps SDK key that is passed in when running the script.

```
$ node importer.js <Google Key>
```
